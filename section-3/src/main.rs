    // Array Types
    // Another way of storing multiple values are arrays.
    // Arrays must contain values with same types.

    // FLOATING-POINT TYPES
    // Rust has two types for floating-point numbers. One is `f32` other is `f64`.

    // Booleans are one byte in size.
    let t = true;
    let f = false;

    // CHAR TYPE
    // It is a Rust's most primitive alphabetic type.

    // Naming convention of Rust on constants is it should be all uppercase with underscores between words.
